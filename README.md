## üìù Project Objective

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of road accident data across two years (**2021 & 2022**) to identify key factors and trends contributing to a total of **417,883** casualties. The objective is to uncover actionable insights using Microsoft Excel to inform potential safety improvements and public awareness campaigns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Excel Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Aggregation:** Created multiple **Pivot Tables** to summarize complex data across various dimensions.
* **Data Calculation:** Employed **Formulas** and calculated fields to derive key metrics like casualty percentages.
* **Dashboarding:** Built a dynamic, interactive dashboard with various charts (bar, line, donut) and slicers for intuitive data exploration.
* **Data Visualization:** Used conditional formatting and modern design principles to create a clear and impactful visual summary.

## üìä Key Insights from the Analysis

* **Year-Over-Year Improvement:** A significant positive trend was observed, with total casualties **decreasing by 12%** from 222,146 in 2021 to 195,737 in 2022.

* **Consistent Seasonal Peaks:** Despite the overall decrease, both years show a consistent seasonal pattern where accidents peak late in the year, specifically during **October and November**.

* **Primary Accident Conditions:** The majority of accidents across the dataset occur in seemingly safe conditions: during **daylight** and on **dry roads**. However, **single carriageways** are disproportionately dangerous, accounting for the highest number of incidents.

* **Vehicle Involvement:** Passenger **cars** are the most frequently involved vehicle type. Notably, **motorcycles/bikes** consistently represent the second-highest casualty group, highlighting a significant area for targeted safety campaigns.
